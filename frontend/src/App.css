/* This file is kept minimal as we're migrating to Tailwind CSS */
/* Most styles are now handled by Tailwind classes directly in component files */
/* Custom styles that can't be easily replaced with Tailwind are kept here */

/* Any remaining global styles should be added to index.css using @layer directives */
